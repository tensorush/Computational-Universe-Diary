# :space_invader: :milky_way: :notebook: **Computational Universe Diary**

## :writing_hand: Collection of disparate notes, quotes, anecdotes and jokes revealing the computational nature of the Universe, which essentially means that the Universe computes and is computable.

> The Universe is a multi-way causal hypergraph that computes itself, with the extent of the hypergraph representing space and the progressive self-computation representing the passage of time. [Stephen Wolfram](https://www.wolframphysics.org/visual-summary/dark/)

> On 7 December 1920 at the University of Göttingen in Germany Moses Schönfinkel presented his first and only work entitled Elemente der Logick ("Elements of Logic"), in which he outlined the concept of combinatory logic — the first Turing-complete computational model. [Stephen Wolfram](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/where-did-combinators-come-from-hunting-the-story-of-moses-schonfinkel/)

> According to the Block Universe Theory, the unified four-dimensional fabric of space-time is absolute and pre-determined everywhere and at all time. However, once an observer is introduced as travelling through a specific region of this "frozen" space-time, from their personal point of view the space-time is inevitably perceived as relative, meaning that there can be no agreement reached with other observers upon the precise place and time of any event, including exactly where and when the observer is travelling.

> What is a classical computer? A classical computer is a physical system that processes information by flipping bits in an algorithmic fashion. What is the Universe? The Universe is a physical system that processes information through particle interactions in a consistent fashion, so the Universe can be thought of as a massive-scale quantum computer/computation.

> It is well-known that x86 instruction set is baroque, overcomplicated, and redundantly redundant. It remains Turing-complete even when reduced to the `mov` instruction. Removing all but the `mov` instruction from future iterations of the x86 architecture would have many advantages: the instruction format would be greatly simplified, the expensive decode unit would become much cheaper, and silicon currently used for complex functional units could be repurposed as even more cache. That is, as long as someone else implements the compiler... [Stephen Dolan](https://drwho.virtadpt.net/files/mov.pdf)

> Enter M/o/Vfuscator. A C compiler that compiles programs into `mov` instructions only. [Christopher Domas](https://github.com/Battelle/movfuscator)

> Perhaps the symmetric properties and simple arithmetic of the balanced ternary system as opposed to the binary system will prove to be quite important someday — when the "flip-flop" is replaced by a "flip-flap-flop". [Donald Knuth](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Computer-Programming-Seminumerical-Algorithms/dp/0201896842)

> All of the world's computers as well as almost all natural languages obey the rules of Aristotelian logic (also known as Boolean or binary logic), which makes it possible to unambiguously express any bivalent logical function. Boolean algebra, however, cannot describe the logic of the Aymara language, as it is the only natural language known to be based on the trivalent logic. [Iván Guzmán de Rojas](https://aymara.org/biblio/html/igr/igr.html)

> How do you recognize an extroverted mathematician? Well, they look at YOUR shoes. What this alludes to is that good mathematicians tend to have Asperger's, which means that the parts of the brain that "normal" people use for social cognition and for worrying what other humans think about them, mathematicians use for thinking about abstract problems.
